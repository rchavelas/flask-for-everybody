# flask-for-everybody
A collection of (tested) snippets for using Flask

Each folder has a unique Flask app with the functionalities described in the
folder name. 

To run an app, go to the folder and excecute it in the console with the 'flask
run --debug' flag. If no flag is required, the app.py or __init__.py will 
specify how to run the app, otherwise, use this command from the command line in
each directory:

    'flask run --debug'
