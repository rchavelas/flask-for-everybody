# flask-for-everybody
A collection of (tested) snippets for using Flask

Each folder has a unique Flask app with the functionalities described in the
folder name. 

To run an app, download and go to the folder, then excecute it in the console 
with the 'flask run --debug' flag. If no flag is required, the app.py or 
__ init __.py will specify how to run the app, otherwise, use this command 
from the command line in each directory:

    flask run --debug
